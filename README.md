## Introduction ü•ò

Overcooked-AI is a benchmark environment for fully cooperative human-AI task performance, based on the wildly popular video game [Overcooked](http://www.ghosttowngames.com/overcooked/).

The goal of the game is to deliver soups as fast as possible. Each soup requires placing up to 3 ingredients in a pot, waiting for the soup to cook, and then having an agent pick up the soup and delivering it. The agents should split up tasks on the fly and coordinate effectively in order to achieve high reward.

You can **try out the game [here](https://humancompatibleai.github.io/overcooked-demo/)** (playing with some previously trained DRL agents). To play with your own trained agents using this interface, or to collect more human-AI or human-human data, you can use the code [here](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai/tree/master/src/overcooked_demo). You can find some human-human and human-AI gameplay data already collected [here](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai/tree/master/src/human_aware_rl/static/human_data).

DRL implementations compatible with the environment are included in the repo as a submodule under src/human_aware_rl. 

The old [human_aware_rl](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/human_aware_rl) is being deprecated and should only used to reproduce the results in the 2019 paper: *[On the Utility of Learning about Humans for Human-AI Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05789)* (also see our [blog post](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/10/21/coordination/)).

For simple usage of the environment, it's worthwhile considering using [this environment wrapper](https://github.com/Stanford-ILIAD/PantheonRL).

## Installation ‚òëÔ∏è

### Installing from PyPI üóú

You can install the pre-compiled wheel file using pip.
```
pip install overcooked-ai
```
Note that PyPI releases are stable but infrequent. For the most up-to-date development features, build from source with `pip install -e .`.


### Building from source üîß

It is useful to setup a conda environment with Python 3.7 (virtualenv works too):

```
conda create -n overcooked_ai python=3.7
conda activate overcooked_ai
```

Clone the repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai.git
```
Finally, use python setup-tools to locally install

If you just want to use the environment:

```
pip install -e .
```

If you also need the DRL implementations (you may have to input this in your terminal as `pip install -e '.[harl]'`):

```
pip install -e .[harl]
```


### Verifying Installation üìà

When building from source, you can verify the installation by running the Overcooked unit test suite. The following commands should all be run from the `overcooked_ai` project root directory:

```
python testing/overcooked_test.py
```

To check whether the `humam_aware_rl` is installed correctly, you can run the following command from the `src/human_aware_rl` directory:

```
$ ./run_tests.sh
```

‚ö†Ô∏è**Be sure to change your CWD to the human_aware_rl directory before running the script, as the test script uses the CWD to dynamically generate a path to save temporary training runs/checkpoints. The testing script will fail if not being run from the correct directory.**

This will run all tests belonging to the human_aware_rl module. You can checkout the README in the submodule for instructions of running target-specific tests. This can be initiated from any directory.

If you're thinking of using the planning code extensively, you should run the full testing suite that verifies all of the Overcooked accessory tools (this can take 5-10 mins): 
```
python -m unittest discover -s testing/ -p "*_test.py"
```


## Code Structure Overview üó∫

- `game.py`: The main logic of the game. State transitions are handled by overcooked.Gridworld object embedded in the game environment
- `move_agents.py`: A script that simplifies copying checkpoints to [agents](src/overcooked_demo/server/static/assets/agents/) directory. Instruction of how to use can be found inside the file or by running `python move_agents.py -h`

`up.sh`: Shell script to spin up the Docker server that hosts the game 


## Python Visualizations üå†

See [this Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AAVP2P-QQhbx6WTOnIG54NXLXFbO7y6n#scrollTo=Z1RBlqADnTDw) for some sample code for visualizing trajectories in python.

We have incorporated a [notebook](Overcooked%20Tutorial.ipynb) that guides users on the process of training, loading, and evaluating agents. Ideally, we would like to enable users to execute the notebook in Google Colab; however, due to Colab's default kernel being Python 3.10 and our repository being optimized for Python 3.7, some functions are presently incompatible with Colab. To provide a seamless experience, we have pre-executed all the cells in the notebook, allowing you to view the expected output when running it locally following the appropriate setup.

Overcooked_demo can also start an interactive game in the browser for visualizations. Details can be found in its [README](src/overcooked_demo/README.md)

## Raw Data :ledger:

The raw data used in training is >100 MB, which makes it inconvenient to distribute via git. The code uses pickled dataframes for training and testing, but in case one needs to original data it can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aGV8eqWeOG5BMFdUcVoP2NHU_GFPqi57?usp=share_link)
